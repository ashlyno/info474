        <h2>Question 1: What is the average effectiveness of each antibiotic?</h2>
            <p>The graph below describes the average effectiveness of each type of antibiotic. I believe when beginning to understand
                data by using visualizations, it is useful to start with a simple chart like this. By using a bar chart, users can 
                quickly percieve that there are 3 different types of antibiotics and their relative average effectiveness for all 15 
                types of bacteria. This allows us to get a first glance at what our data looks like and to begin to understand the story
                behind this data. So length in this chart shows the average effectiveness. I chose this because it's relatively simple
                to identify the longest bars in this graph, and I think it accurately represents how effective penicilin is. Next, I used 
                color in order to differentiate between each bar. I selected blue for penicilin because your eyes are naturally drawn to the 
                bar anyways since it is much larger, so I wanted to use a color that didn't take over the entire graph. Therefore, I used stronger
                colors like red and green to catch the users eyes for the other charts. This allows for users to easily identify where the other bars
                are located. I also chose to use a log axis since the penecilin had a much higher average effectiveness. I think this visualization
                is best for representing data such as this because it is simple, clear, and straight to the point. Unlike a pie chart or a scatter
                plot, it is easy to get a clear picture from this graph.

        <h2>Question 2: How effective is each antibiotic on each type of bacteria?</h2>
        <p> In this visualization I wanted to begin to dive deeper into this data set. I thought an important aspect to analyze was the different types
            of bacteria that were analyzed and how effective each antibiotic was on each of them. I wanted to create this graph after I began to wonder
            if just because penecilin had the highest average effectiveness, did that mean it was the best antibiotic for every bacteria? In order to 
            get this information, I chose to use a stacked bar chart. This allows me to look at each bacteria, as well as the effectiveness of each drug.
            This may had been possible using something like scatter plots or pie charts, but I felt those graphs would be too cluttered and force the users
            to really work to understand the chart. Therefore, a simple stacked bar chart allows us to compare the different effectiveness of each
            drug very quickly. One issue I do find with this dataset is that again, penecilin is much more effective and it can make the other antibiotics 
            harder to see. The same color legend as before is also used again, this was intentional to avoid confusing the user. I think this visualization was 
            very effective, considering I was able to quickly identify that Penecilin is a very good antibiotic, but sometimes Streptomycin was better.

        <h2>Question 3: Which antibiotic is more effective on gram stain? </h2>
        <p> Lastly, I wanted to include the gram stain into this analysis. It would be helpful to understand which types of gram strains each antibiotic was 
            better at treating in order to identify when a certain antibiotic should be used. Again, I battled with using something such as a scatter plot or a 
            pie chart, but I do not think they convey the information nearly as well. For one, when using a pie chart for this data, the user misses the differences
            between the effectiveness for negative and positive stains. A pie chart misses this because the size of the pie charts for each gram stain are still the same, even if the 
            slices are different. On the other hand, a grouped bar chart lets us see not only which antibiotic was better for one gram stain, but it lets us 
            also compare them to the opposite gram stain. This grouped bar chart gives us twice the information. I once again went with the same color scheme in order
            to not confuse the user. The log axis was also used again to ensure visibility.
